# Stridemap
StrideMap is a web application that allows users to generate, analyse, and discover running routes in Brisbane based on distance and elevation preferences. Users can specify start and end locations, desired distance, elevation gain, and route type (loop or point-to-point). The app leverages OpenStreetMap and DEM from OpenTopography data, PostGIS, and pgRouting for route generation and analysis.
